            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>Ages of Ainor began in 2018 as an attempt to help D&D and TTRPG players and GMs connect online and at conventions. BonusMom and Pixl founded Ages of Ainor after attending several sci-fi and fantasy conventions in the mid-atlantic US and finding that there were often far more TTRPG players than GMs and that sign ups were often running out far before everyone got a chance to play who came to the convention interested in playing. Pixl would often set down at an open table and play pick-up games of D&D 5e and found that there were enough players to fill up a table any time he set up - meaning there were lots of folks not getting to play who wanted to. Pixl and BonusMom also heard from many GMs who wouldn't GM at cons because they were Forever GMs of their home groups and often came to cons to get chances to play - and then sometimes didn't get to because there weren't enough other GMs running. So, Pixl and BonusMom thought these might be two problems that solved each other - lots of people wanting to play and plenty of GMs who wanted opportunity to be PCs meant that if the GMs would be willing to GM every once in a while in exchange for getting chances to be a PC then we could build a community where the GMs help each other out and give each other chances to play PCs and we could have public-facing D&D sign ups for players to get chances to play.</p>
            <p>During the Covid-19 pandemic, the sci-fi and fantasy convetions we had been attending understandably stopped, and we moved most of the Ages of Ainor operation online through Discord and Roll20 and other online tools to help run D&D and TTRPG games. We also began a live stream of D&D 5e on twitch with our Waterdeep: Dragon Heist campaign as a way to show people our D&D community and to help recruit players and GMs. We eventually ran several other campaigns - including the Siege of Castle Rend by MCDM productions and the Curse of Strahd with our good friend Vyncent Paige. Through the various streams, BonusMom cemented her place as an internet legend and started her TikTok.</p>
            <p>BonusMom's TikTok page went semi-viral and we had an explosion of new players and GMs joining our community in 2022 and Ages of Ainor has been growing faster than ever. We have onboarded dozens of new GMs and players who haver games up and running in the discord all the time. We're extremely pleased to welcome all our new friends, and we hope you'll join us as well!</p>
