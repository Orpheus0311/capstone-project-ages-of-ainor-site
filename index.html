            <h2>Who are we?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Ages of Ainor is a community of Dungeons & Dragons and TTRPG players and GMs dedicated to finding ways to provide more opportunities for people to play how they want to play</li>
                <li>We believe that this game is for anyone, that every edition of this game and style of play is fun (and is the right kind of fun for some people), and that new people should have a chance to learn this game in a fun, safe, and welcoming environment</li>
                <li>We feel strongly that DMs/GMs deserve chances to play as PCs and that new people deserve chances to try to DM/GM for the first time and can often benefit from the support of fellow DMs and GMs in taking on that role for the first time.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What do we do?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>We host one-shot D&D games online through our discord in a safe, inclusive, respectful, and welcoming community of gamers</li>
                <li>We try to connect people who want to play with people who want to DM/GM</li>
                <li>We encourage DMs/GMs to prepare and run the kind of games/adventures that they enjoy and are excited about and we try to help them connect with players who want to play in that kind of game</li>
                <li>We stream D&D and TTRPGs on twitch</li>
            </ul>
